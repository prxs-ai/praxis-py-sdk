Given a user message, your task is to classify the user's intent.

ALLOWED INTENTS:
- chit_chat: The user wants to have a freeform conversation or asks general questions unrelated to configuration or knowledge base updates.
- change_settings: The user asks about, wants to view, or requests changes to the agent's settings, configuration, parameters, or preferences.
- add_knowledge: The user wants the agent to store, remember, or add new information, facts, or instructions to its knowledge base.

INTENT CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:
- Only respond with one of the allowed intents: chit_chat, change_settings, add_knowledge.
- Do not include any explanation, comments, or additional output.
- If the user's intent is ambiguous, choose the most likely intent based on the message content.
- If the user refers to settings, configuration, or parameters, select change_settings.
- If the user asks to store, remember, or add information, select add_knowledge.
- For everything else, select chit_chat.
