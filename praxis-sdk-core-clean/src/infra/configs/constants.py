Introduction
The rise of decentralized applications has surged the demand for sophisticated AI solutions. Yet, users and developers face significant hurdles, including poor discoverability, reliability issues, and integration challenges. AGIX tackles these problems head-on by launching a decentralized marketplace for blockchain AI agents, powered by Towards AGI.


The Core Challenge in the AI Web3 Market
The AI and crypto markets are inundated with numerous AI solutions, leading to several critical issues. These challenges can be segmented into those faced by users, developers, and technology.

Challenges for Users
	•	Discoverability: Users struggle to find and differentiate high-quality AI tools amidst numerous offerings, resulting in confusion and inefficiency.
	•	Reliability of Single-Party Decision Making: Relying on a single AI tool is risky, as it limits perspectives and increases the chance of error or bias.
	•	Routine Manual Tasks: Current AI solutions lack the integration with popular DeFi products. Users must manually visit multiple data sources on routine tasks such as checking market conditions, monitoring social media for news, and analyzing project security, which could be automated with revolutionary single-chat AI interface to interact with all DeFi projects.

Challenges for Developers
	•	Marketing Challenges: Developers struggle to make their AI solutions stand out and gain visibility in a crowded market, limiting their reach and impact.
	•	Integration Difficulties: Technical barriers hinder the integration of diverse AI tools into user workflows, discouraging innovation and collaboration among developers.

Technological Challenges
	•	Lack of ML-Ops, Self-Learning, and Scoring: Current marketplaces lack transparent scoring systems and self-learning mechanisms, hindering AI models’ improvement over time and reducing trust in their reliability.
	•	Limited Context and Action Capabilities: Current Language Learning Models (LLMs) are confined to specific channels and cannot perform real-world actions, limiting their usefulness and applicability.


Towards AGI — a Big Step Towards Artificial General Intelligence.

Towards AGI – the groundbreaking Multi-Agent AI Orchestrator, acts as the ultimate AI command center, orchestrating a symphony of AI agents to perform complex tasks with precision and efficiency. Think of it as the AI-driven CEO that manages and optimizes your AI workforce, ensuring the most relevant agents are selected and deployed to meet your needs.

Decentralized Marketplace of Blockchain AI Agents Powered by Towards AGI


The AGIX Marketplace is a revolutionary platform where cutting-edge AI agents converge with the decentralized world of blockchain. This dynamic marketplace allows users to discover, deploy, and integrate a diverse array of AI agents, all powered by advanced Towards AGI and fortified by blockchain technology.

The marketplace integrates ML-Ops, self-learning, and auto-scoring systems. Each agent has a score and the ability to self-criticize to improve its performance over time. Users can work with any data sources, any type of content, and any analytical tools within a single interface.

Use Cases of Towards AGI

Example 1: Buying New Tokens

User Request: “I want to buy the top 10 AI tokens for 1 ETH. Analyze if the projects are safe and bullish, and build my portfolio.”

Marketplace AI Agents Involved:
	•	CoinMarketCap Data
	•	AI-Security-Audit
	•	AI-Technical-Analysis
	•	DEX Swap: AI-Agent DEX
	•	Historical-Token-Data
	•	Social-Media-AI: (Twitter, Discord, Website)

Towards AGI Process:
	1.	Use the CoinMarketCap Integration to retrieve the top 100 AI tokens.
	2.	Execute AI-Security-Audit to evaluate the security of these tokens.
	3.	Run Historical-Token-Data and AI-Technical-Analysis.
	4.	Gather data from Twitter and Discord and analyze it with Social-Media-AI.
	5.	Select the top 10 tokens based on the combined analysis.
	6.	Use the DEX agent to build a transaction for the user to sign.

Incentivization: Tokens spent by the user are withdrawn from their deposit and distributed among the team who created the agents.

Self-Learning / Scoring / MLOps: With user permission, every request is recorded and used for self-learning and auto-agent scoring, enhancing future performance.

Example 2: Market Monitoring

User Request: “I would like to monitor tokens in the 0x123abc123abc portfolio and get notified of any unusual events every 30 minutes. Send updates to my Telegram @CryptoKing.”

Marketplace AI Agents Involved:
	•	Etherscan
	•	CoinGecko
	•	DexTools
	•	Twitter Agent
	•	TelegramAgent

Towards AGI Process:
	1.	Use Etherscan and CoinGecko to retrieve the wallet portfolio and token prices.
	2.	Employ DexTools to check the trading activity of each token.
	3.	Use the Twitter Agent to monitor the latest tweets related to the tokens.
	4.	Analyze the data to identify any unusual activity.
	5.	Repeat the analysis every 30 minutes.
	6.	Send updates to @CryptoKing via TelegramAgent if any unusual events are detected.

Example 3: Project Launch

Step 1: Create a Crypto Project
	•	Bullish Narrative Identification: Use an AI agent skilled in finding the most bullish narratives of the past week.
	•	Blueprint Generation: Utilize a project blueprint generator AI agent to create a blueprint based on selected narratives, including name, description, vision, mission, tokenomics, and a picture.
	•	White Paper Creation: An AI agent specializing in writing whitepapers takes the blueprint, conducts research, and synthesizes relevant scientific papers to produce a comprehensive PDF whitepaper.
	•	Website Generation: An AI agent skilled in web development takes the whitepaper and blueprint to create a website.
	•	Smart Contract Generation: An AI agent proficient in smart contract development generates the necessary contracts.

Result: Combining these agents, you get a one-click crypto project generator.

Step 2: Create a Marketing Podcast

"AGX Elevator Pitch

Problem:
People are using only 2% of AI’s true power! Users still interact with computers like it’s the early 2000s—switching tabs, clicking buttons, and manually performing repetitive tasks. ChatGPT and similar AI tools are more like chatbots, requiring constant human input and unable to autonomously perform complex, multi-step tasks.

Examples:
Write Elevator Pitch for AGX, read website, twitter and WP, analyze competitors.
Go to my telegram VSmelov/Pa$$word, reply stupid questions and give me summary
Check all internet and find 10 most interesting erc20 tokens launched on this week
Order the same food delivery as yesterday.
Twice a day, ask every dev in my team when they current tasks will be done
Every 5min check news about wallet portfolio tokens and sell if Pavel Durov arrested
Solution:
AGX - fully autonomous AI with tools in hands!
AGX has full control over Internet Browser and specialized integrations to process any request, even if it requires 100 steps—visiting websites, clicking buttons, fetching APIs, writing posts, etc. It automates up to 90% of your daily digital work, so you can focus on what really matters.

Text2Action:
AGX goes beyond simply generating text responses—it interacts with the real world through a wide range of integrations. Your requests turn into real actions: AGX can write and post a tweet, execute a Web3 transaction, or even order your favorite food delivery.

Marketplace and Community:
A key feature of AGIX is its decentralized marketplace, where a global community of developers and teams can create, integrate, and monetize their AI agents and tools. This collaborative ecosystem allows for continuous innovation and expansion of capabilities.

Next Steps:
Our first milestone is to automate 98% of daily Web3 user tasks, conquering the Web3 market before expanding to Web2 on a global scale."
